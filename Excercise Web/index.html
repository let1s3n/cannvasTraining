            House Baratheon of Storm's End is a legally extinct Great House of Westeros. A cadet branch was
            formerly the royal house, but House Lannister now controls the throne. House Baratheon
            traditionally ruled the Stormlands on the eastern coast of Westeros, aptly named for its
            frequent storms, from their seat of Storm's End.

            House Targaryen of Dragonstone is a Great House of Westeros and was the ruling royal House of
            the Seven Kingdoms for three centuries since it conquered and unified the realm, before it was
            deposed during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal House. The
            two surviving Targaryens fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow Sea.
            Currently based on Dragonstone off of the eastern coast of Westeros, House Targaryen seeks to
            retake the Seven Kingdoms from House Lannister, who formally replaced House Baratheon as the
            royal House following the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor.

            of the Five Kings and Daenerys Targaryen's invasion of Westeros, the leaders of House Stark ruled over the
